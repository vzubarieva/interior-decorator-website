  <h1>Set Up a Cozy Reading Spot</h1>
  <p>No designated reading nook? No problem. If your home doesn't have any leftover real estate to convert into a reading nook, design your formal living room to serve double duty as a cozy lounge area.

  <p>The soft black paint color in this bedroom makes it feel special and intimate in ways you'd never be able to achieve with a lighter hue (this specific shade is Farrow & Ball Railings). The eclectic furniture lends itself nicely to the darkness, too, adding a more lived in and homey vibe.</p>
